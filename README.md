## Description

Welcome to my first web development project, Login_Reg_Form! This project showcases my skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It is a simple signup page that allows users to register by providing their username and password. The project demonstrates my understanding of connecting CSS and JavaScript to HTML, as well as storing data locally in the browser.

## Project Features

- Responsive User Interface: The signup page is designed to be responsive and adapt to various screen sizes.
- Input Validation: JavaScript is used to validate user input and ensure the required fields are filled before submitting the form.
- Local Data Storage: User registration data is stored locally in the browser using `localStorage`. This allows users to see their saved data even after closing and reopening the webpage.

## Project Structure

- `index.html`: The main HTML file containing the structure of the signup page.
- `styles.css`: The CSS file for styling the user interface of the signup page.
- `script.js`: The JavaScript file responsible for connecting the functionality and validation to the HTML elements.

## How to Run the Project

1. Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/Login_Reg_Form.git
   ```

2. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser.

## Future Improvements

- Implement a complete login and registration system with server-side validation and user authentication.
- Enhance the user interface with additional styles and animations.

## Technologies Used

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
